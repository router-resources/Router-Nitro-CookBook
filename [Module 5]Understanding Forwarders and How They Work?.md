### How does Router Protocol uses Forwarders?

Router Protocol employs a trustless method for managing CrossChain asset transfers. In this system, a forwarder entity delivers the requested asset to the user on the destination chain. After confirming the forwarder's successful settlement on the destination chain, they can access the user's deposited funds on the source chain.
