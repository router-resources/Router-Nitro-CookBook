# Conclusion

In conclusion, Module 5 has outlined the essential prerequisites for learning and building dApps on Router Nitro effectively. To embark on the journey of mastering Router Nitro and contributing to its ecosystem, individuals should fulfill the above requirements.

# `Module 6: Understanding Forwarders and How They Work?`

Welcome to Module 6 Of Router Nitro CookBook. In this module, we'll be understanding what are forwarders, how do they work, and how Router Protocol has been implementing it. Let's Begin...

### What are Forwarders?

![forwarders](https://github.com/router-resources/Router-Nitro-CookBook/assets/124175970/b8e783e5-d5dd-41b7-a1c9-94157fc3b04d)

- Picture a scenario where you need to transfer funds from Bank A to Bank B. In this process, Router Nitro acts as an intermediary, collecting the money from Bank A, and then its partners, referred to as forwarders, personally convey the funds to Bank B. Following the transfer, Router Nitro undertakes a crucial verification step to ensure that the amount you originally deposited in Bank A matches the amount that arrives at Bank B. If the verification is successful, Router Nitro‚Äôs partners retrieve the funds they initially transferred to your Bank B, effectively completing the transaction.

- Router Nitro has three flows with which it enables this swapping -

1. **Forwarder Flow:** It uses a trustless optimistic approach to handle cross-chain asset transfers and has an entity called the forwarder that provides the users with their desired assets on the destination chain.
2. **Burn and Mint flow:** For certain tokens, the bridge has mint/burn rights, which allows the bridge to burn the tokens on one chain and mint them on another.
3. **USDC circle flow:** This flow uses Circle‚Äôs CCTP infra to provide cross-chain transfers of USDC. The flow works for USDC transfers on chains where CCTP is live.

- Now, we will be covering the Forwarder flow, and before we do that, here are some terms and their explanations for you to understand the flow in a better way

1. **Orchestrators:** It ensures that all the validators and relayers are playing in sync and that the information being passed between them is accurate and legitimate.
2. **Middleware contract:** It is a contract which is deployed on the Router chain, which enables custom business logic directly in the bridging layer.
3. **IBC:** Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol is an open-source protocol to handle authentication and transport of data between blockchains (within the Cosmos ecosystem.
4. **Gateway contracts:** Gateway contracts serve as the interface for the application contracts on any chain to interact with contracts on other chains.

### How does Router Nitro implement the Forwarders?

- In the forwarder flow, first of all, a user invokes the Nitro contract to transfer funds from Chain A (source) to Chain B (destination). The source chain Nitro contract will validate the request, deduct funds from the user‚Äôs account, increment event nonce and emit a FundsDeposited event. Whenever a FundsDeposited event is emitted from a Nitro contract, Orchestrators listen to this event and submit the event to the Router chain along with their attestation. Parallely, the forwarders also listen to the FundsDeposited event.

- After 2/3+1 validation, the Router chain will invoke the middleware Nitro contract with the event info, and after this, the middleware contract will persist with the request! While the event was being processed on the Router chain (attestation, validator, submission on the middleware contract), in parallel, the forwarder also listens to the FundsDeposited event and invokes the Nitro contract on the destination chain.

- Upon receiving the transaction, the Nitro contract on the destination chain will (a) transfer the defined amount from the forwarder address to the receiver address, (b) create a hash of the fields included in the request and persist it in the status map (to skip the replays), and ¬© emit a FundsPaid event confirming the execution.Orchestrators on the Router chain listen to the FundsPaid event from the destination chain Nitro contract and submit it to the Router chain with their attestation. Upon receiving the FundsPaid event, the middleware contract verifies that the message generated from the request data is the same as the message hash from the executed event, marks the request as Completed and persists the forwarder address and amount.

So, just like that, Router Nitro bridges your assets from Chain A to Chain B efficiently, securely, and with minimal cost using the reverse verification flow!

# Conclusion

In conclusion, Module 6 of Router Nitro CookBook provided an in-depth understanding of forwarders and how they function within the Router Protocol ecosystem. By leveraging forwarders, Router Nitro facilitates cross-chain asset transfers efficiently and securely. The module outlined three key flows utilized by Router Nitro, namely the Forwarder Flow, Burn and Mint Flow, and the USDC Circle Flow, each catering to specific token transfer scenarios.

Moreover, the module introduced essential terms such as Orchestrators, Middleware contracts, IBC, and Gateway contracts to better comprehend the intricacies of the Forwarder Flow. It elucidated the step-by-step process involved in transferring funds from one chain to another, highlighting the crucial roles played by Orchestrators and forwarders in ensuring transaction validity and execution.

Through a detailed examination of the forwarder flow implementation, Module 6 illustrated how Router Nitro bridges assets seamlessly across different chains while maintaining security and minimizing costs. By employing a reverse verification flow, Router Nitro completes asset transfers with accuracy and reliability, thus offering users a robust solution for interoperability in the blockchain space.

# `Module 7: Explaining the CodeBase of Router Nitro - Part 1`

Welcome to Module 7 Of Router Nitro CookBook. In this module, we'll be looking at a dApp and understanding its CodeBase. This is the Part 1 of understanding the CodeBase. Let's Begin...

### Understanding the CodeBase Part- 1

![gif](https://github.com/router-resources/Voyager-2-Cookbook/assets/124175970/7add0a31-99d0-4d16-9e7d-9f8a3390bfb7)

It's very easy to integrate Nitro in your dApp. All you need is a 20 lines of copy paste code ! **Clone this repository**,hit **npm install** to install all the neccessary package and libraries and hit **npm run dev** to start the demo dapp. All you need to do is change some parameters based on the dapp that you are building. You find all the suppoted chains and assets [ here](https://docs.routerprotocol.com/develop/voyager/voyager-v2.0/supported-chains-tokens)

This Demo app demonstrate how to use Nitro to transsfer USDT from Polygon Mumbai to Avalanche Fuji. Note, this dApp is just made for demonstration purpose. After having this dapp code on your local system, you can modify it (change thee parameters) based on the dapp you want to build.

After you have run the dApp on your localhost, it's time to undertand how does the dApp works.

All you need is just 3 easy steps to integrate Voyager into any dapp :-

Step1: Get the Quote

Step2: Check and set allowance

Step3: Execute the transaction

![Untitled Workspace](https://github.com/router-resources/Voyager-2-Cookbook/assets/124175970/0e7775f5-cf4f-41b1-a57d-bfc57e2fc44f)

### Step1: Get the Quote

Router Nitro enables you to interact with the nitro contract and initiate CrossChain token transfers. The first step in this process is to request a quote, which provides you with essential details about the proposed token transfer.

To request a quote, follow these steps:

1. **Define the PATH_FINDER_API_URL:** Set the PATH_FINDER_API_URL variable to the URL of the Pathfinder API for the Voyager testnet. This is where you will send your quote request.

   ```javascript
   const PATH_FINDER_API_URL = "https://api.pf.testnet.routerprotocol.com/api";
   ```

2. **Create the `getQuote` Function:** This function handles the quote request. It uses the `axios` library to make an HTTP GET request to the Voyager Pathfinder API.

   ```javascript
   const getQuote = async (params) => {
     const endpoint = "v2/quote";
     const quoteUrl = `${PATH_FINDER_API_URL}/${endpoint}`;
     try {
       const res = await axios.get(quoteUrl, { params });
       return res.data;
     } catch (e) {
       console.error(`Fetching quote data from pathfinder: ${e}`);
     }
   };
   ```

3. **Call the `getQuote` Function:** Use this function to request a quote by passing appropriate parameters.In this repository , this function is called using a a button.

```javascript
// Example usage:
const quoteParams = {
  fromTokenAddress: from,
  toTokenAddress: to,
  amount: amount,
  fromTokenChainId: "80001",
  toTokenChainId: "43113", // Fuji

  widgetId: 0, // get your unique wdiget id by contacting us on Telegram
};

const quoteData = await getQuote(quoteParams);
console.log("Quote Data:", quoteData);
```

These parameters define the details of the token transfer you wish to execute. Let's break down what each parameter represents:

- `'fromTokenAddress'`: This should specify the address of the token you want to transfer from (the source token).

- `'toTokenAddress'`: Provide the address of the token you want to transfer to (the destination token).

- `'amount'`: Set the amount of the token you wish to transfer.

- `'fromTokenChainId'`: This parameter represents the chain ID of the source blockchain. In this case, it's set to "80001."

- `'toTokenChainId'`: Similarly, this parameter specifies the chain ID of the destination blockchain, which, in this example, is "43113" (Fuji).

- `'widgetId'`: This parameter is used to identify the widget responsible for the transfer. You'll typically need to obtain a unique widget ID through contact with the Voyager team, often via Telegram or other means. For now, let's keep it as 0.

With these parameters, you can now call the `getQuote` function with this `params` object to initiate a quote request for your specific token transfer.

   <img width="197" alt="image" src="https://github.com/router-resources/Voyager-2-Cookbook/assets/124175970/5867052e-301e-46c6-b206-24094c19298e">

### Response

The `getQuote` function returns the quote data, which typically includes details about the token transfer, such as source and destination chains, token amount, fees, and other relevant information.Click the **Get Quote** button and go to console to see the quote data printed on console.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, Module 7 of Understanding the CodeBase introduced users to the seamless integration of Nitro into their decentralized applications (dApps). By following a straightforward process outlined in just 20 lines of code, developers can effectively incorporate Nitro into their projects, facilitating cross-chain token transfers.

The module demonstrated a practical example using a demo dApp to transfer USDT from Polygon Mumbai to Avalanche Fuji. After setting up the dApp locally and modifying parameters as per individual project requirements, users embarked on understanding the three fundamental steps to integrate Voyager into any dApp:

1. **Step 1: Get the Quote:** Users initiated the token transfer process by requesting a quote from the Nitro contract through the Pathfinder API. The quote provided essential details about the proposed token transfer, including source and destination chains, token amounts, and associated fees.

2. **Step 2: Check and Set Allowance:** Once users obtained the quote, they were prompted to check and set the necessary allowances for the token transfer to proceed smoothly.

3. **Step 3: Execute the Transaction:** With all prerequisites met, users executed the transaction, initiating the cross-chain token transfer from the source to the destination chain.

The module provided detailed insights into each step, including code snippets and explanations, to guide developers through the integration process effectively. By following the outlined steps, developers can seamlessly incorporate Nitro into their dApps, enabling efficient and secure cross-chain token transfers.

# `Module 8: Explaining the CodeBase of Router Nitro - Part 2`

Welcome to Module 8 Of Router Nitro CookBook. In this module, we'll be looking at a dApp and understanding its CodeBase. In the previous module, we understood about **Step 1** which is getting the quote data. This is the Part 2 of understanding the CodeBase. Let's Begin...

### Understanding the CodeBase Part- 2

In this module, we'll be understanding the step 2, i.e Checking and Setting an Allowance.

### Step2: Check and set allowance

In Step 2 of using Router Nitro, you'll verify and configure the allowance for token transfers. This process allows Router's swap or transfer contract to safely move tokens on your behalf between blockchain networks.

```
import { ethers, Contract } from 'ethers'

// ERC20 Contract ABI for "Approve" and "Allowance" functions
const erc20_abi = [
    {
        "name": "approve",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "internalType": "address",
                "name": "spender",
                "type": "address"
            },
            {
                "internalType": "uint256",
                "name": "amount",
                "type": "uint256"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "internalType": "bool",
                "name": "",
                "type": "bool"
            }
        ],
        "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
        "type": "function"
    },
    {
        "name": "allowance",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "internalType": "address",
                "name": "owner",
                "type": "address"
            },
            {
                "internalType": "address",
                "name": "spender",
                "type": "address"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "internalType": "uint256",
                "name": "",
                "type": "uint256"
            }
        ],
        "stateMutability": "view",
        "type": "function"
    }
];

// Fetch the current allowance and update if needed
const checkAndSetAllowance = async (wallet, tokenAddress, approvalAddress, amount) => {
    // Transactions with the native token don't need approval
    if (tokenAddress === ethers.constants.AddressZero) {
        return
    }

    const erc20 = new Contract(tokenAddress, erc20_abi, wallet);
    const allowance = await erc20.allowance(await wallet.getAddress(), approvalAddress);
    if (allowance.lt(amount)) {
        const approveTx = await erc20.approve(approvalAddress, amount, {gasPrice: await wallet.provider.getGasPrice()});
        try {
            await approveTx.wait();
            console.log(`Transaction mined succesfully: ${approveTx.hash}`)
        }
        catch (error) {
            console.log(`Transaction failed with error: ${error}`)
        }
    }
}
```

1. **Define ERC20 Contract ABI:** We begin by defining the ABI (Application Binary Interface) for ERC20 tokens, specifically focusing on the "approve" and "allowance" functions. This ABI is essential for interacting with ERC20 token contracts.

2. **The `checkAndSetAllowance` Function:** This function checks your current allowance and, if necessary, sets a new allowance. It first checks if the token is the native token (ETH), in which case no approval is needed.

3. **Creating an ERC20 Contract:** Using the provided token address and the ERC20 ABI, we create an instance of the ERC20 contract. This contract represents the token you want to set an allowance for.

4. **Checking Current Allowance:** We retrieve your current allowance for the token. The allowance is the maximum amount the Voyager system (or any other address) can withdraw from your wallet.

5. **Setting the Allowance:** If the current allowance is less than the desired amount, we proceed to set a new allowance. We initiate an approval transaction to the ERC20 contract, granting permission to Router's swap or transfer contract to withdraw tokens on your behalf.

6. **Handling Transactions:** The code handles the approval transaction, monitors its status, and logs the transaction hash upon successful confirmation.

When the button is clicked your signer (wallet) is set up and the `checkAndSetAllowance` function is called with the required parameters. You can find it in quote.allowanceTo in the quoteData obtained from step 1

Please replace `"YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"` and other placeholders with your actual private key and the specific token details.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, Module 8 of the Router Nitro CookBook provided a detailed examination of Step 2 in using Router Nitro: checking and setting an allowance for token transfers. This crucial step ensures the safe and secure movement of tokens between blockchain networks through Router's swap or transfer contract.

The module delved into the codebase, offering insights into the implementation of the checkAndSetAllowance function, which automates the process of verifying and configuring allowances for token transfers. Here's a breakdown of the key components discussed:

1. **ERC20 Contract ABI Definition:** The module began by defining the ABI (Application Binary Interface) for ERC20 tokens, specifically focusing on the "approve" and "allowance" functions. This ABI is essential for interacting with ERC20 token contracts.

2. **checkAndSetAllowance Function:** This function, central to Step 2, checks the current allowance and sets a new allowance if necessary. It first checks if the token is the native token (ETH), in which case no approval is needed. Then, it creates an instance of the ERC20 contract using the provided token address and ABI.

3. **Checking and Setting Allowances:** The function retrieves the current allowance for the token and compares it with the desired amount. If the current allowance is less than the desired amount, a new allowance is set through an approval transaction to the ERC20 contract.

4. **Transaction Handling:** The code efficiently handles the approval transaction, monitoring its status and logging the transaction hash upon successful confirmation.

By providing developers with a clear understanding of the codebase and its functionalities, Module 8 empowers them to seamlessly integrate Router Nitro into their decentralized applications, facilitating efficient and secure cross-chain token transfers. Through these insights, developers can leverage Router Nitro to enhance interoperability across diverse blockchain networks, unlocking new possibilities in the decentralized finance landscape.

# `Module 9: Explaining the CodeBase of Router Nitro - Part 3`

Welcome to Module 9 Of Router Nitro CookBook. In this module, we'll be looking at a dApp and understanding its CodeBase. In the previous module, we understood about **Step 2** which is checking and setting the allowance. This is the Part 3 of understanding the CodeBase. Let's Begin...

### Understanding the CodeBase Part- 3

In this module, we'll be understanding the step 3, i.e getTransaction.

### Step3: Executing the Transaction

In this step, we will explore how to execute a transaction .This process involves sending a transaction to perform the cross-chain token transfer initiated in Step 1 and configured in Step 2.

1. **The `getTransaction` Function:**

This function is responsible for actually executing the transaction. It takes in the following parameters

- **`params`**: Parameters required for the transaction, which should include the source and destination token addresses, slippage tolerance, sender and receiver addresses, and the widget ID.
- **`quoteData`**: Quote data obtained from Step 1.

When the button is clicked, It performs the following tasks using the function defined:-

```
  const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("https://rpc.ankr.com/polygon_mumbai", 80001);

    const wallet = new ethers.Wallet("76313c982e5cfdc0c47e36465e5fa90e0db291667296a7bd163178b955162b13", provider)

	const params ={
		'fromTokenAddress': from,
		'toTokenAddress': to,
		'amount': amount,
		'fromTokenChainId': "80001",
		'toTokenChainId': "43113", // Fuji

		'widgetId': 0, // get your unique wdiget id by contacting us on Telegram
	}

	const quoteData = await getQuote(params);


	console.log(quoteData)

    const txResponse = await getTransaction({
		'fromTokenAddress': from,
		'toTokenAddress': to,
		'fromTokenChainId': "80001",
		'toTokenChainId': "43113", // Fuji

		'widgetId': 0, // get your unique wdiget id by contacting us on Telegram
	}, quoteData); // params have been defined in step 1 and quoteData has also been fetched in step 1

    // sending the transaction using the data given by the pathfinder
    const tx = await wallet.sendTransaction(txResponse.txn.execution)
    try {
        await tx.wait();
        console.log(`Transaction mined successfully: ${tx.hash}`)
    }
    catch (error) {
        console.log(`Transaction failed with error: ${error}`)
    }
```

- **Signer Setup**: Configures a signer using the specified JSON-RPC provider. Replace `"YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"` with your actual private key. You can also use the `provider.getSigner()` method if you're implementing this for a user interface (UI).

- **Retrieve Transaction Data**: Calls the `getTransaction` function with the necessary parameters to fetch the transaction data from the Voyager system.

```
const getTransaction = async (params, quoteData) => {
		const endpoint = "v2/transaction"
		const txDataUrl = `${PATH_FINDER_API_URL}/${endpoint}`

		console.log(txDataUrl)

		try {
			const res = await axios.post(txDataUrl, {
				...quoteData,
				fromTokenAddress: params.fromTokenAddress,
				toTokenAddress: params.toTokenAddress,
				slippageTolerance: 0.5,
				senderAddress: account,
				receiverAddress: account,
				widgetId: params.widgetId
			})
			return res.data;
		} catch (e) {
			console.error(`Fetching tx data from pathfinder: ${e}`)
		}
	}
```

**Send Transaction**: Initiates the transaction using the data obtained from the Voyager system.

**Transaction Handling**: Monitors the transaction status. If the transaction is successfully mined, it logs the transaction hash. If there is an error, it logs an error message.

Please replace `"YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"` with your actual private key and ensure that you have the required parameters, including `params` and `quoteData` obtained from Step 1.
