### Why do we need CrossChain Bridges?

Several factors highlight the need for cross-chain bridges:

**Unlocking diverse functionalities:** Each blockchain possesses unique strengths and weaknesses. For example, Ethereum boasts a vibrant DeFi ecosystem, while Solana offers faster transaction speeds. Bridges allow users to access functionalities across different blockchains, maximizing their utility.

**Enhanced liquidity:** By enabling asset movement between blockchains, bridges increase liquidity across the entire crypto market. This benefits both users and projects, leading to fairer pricing and efficient capital allocation.

**Boosting innovation:** Bridges pave the way for innovative dApps (decentralized applications) that span multiple blockchains. This fosters competition and accelerates the development of the entire blockchain space.
Types of Cross-Chain Bridges:


### Why to Use Router Nitro?

- Router Nitro is the most efficient intent based CrossChain Bridge in Web3. Nitro ensures fund safety by allowing forwarders to claim funds only after verified settlement, deterring malicious activities for robust security.

- Every new Smart Contract you launch needs to go through a Security Audit, so users can have trust in your Security. However, accessing Liquidity from other Chains is still impossible without going through a Bridging Process.

- Amongst all CrossChain Bridges, the amount Of Gas Overspent in Router Nitro is literally 0%.

- Router Nitro's additional Security module allows for perpetual updates to accomodate for Cryptographic Advances in Security.

1. Forwarders can claim funds only after verified settlement, deterring malicious activity.
2. Blockchain Level, Contract Level Security and Code Level Security.
3. Constant Security Updates, that make Nitro one step ahead of the Hackers.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, Module 1 has provided a comprehensive overview of the need for Router Nitro and its significance in the context of CrossChain interoperability. We have explored the fundamental concepts of CrossChain bridges and the challenges associated with inter-blockchain communication.

As we progress through the course, we will delve deeper into the functionalities and technical aspects of Router Nitro, building upon the foundation established in Module 1 to explore its full potential and applications in real-world scenarios.
