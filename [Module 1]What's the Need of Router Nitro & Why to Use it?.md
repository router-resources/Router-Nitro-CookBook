Welcome to the Module 1 Of the Router Nitro CookBook. In this module, we'll be understanding that what's the need of Router Nitro? Why CrossChain Interoperability needs to be catered and why should you only prefer Router Nitro? Let's Begin...

# Module 1: What's the Need of Router Nitro & Why to Use it?

### Why do we need CrossChain Bridges?

- One kind of decentralised application that facilitates asset transfers between blockchains is called a CrossChain Bridge. By enabling CrossChain liquidity between different Blockchains, CrossChain Bridges raise the utility of Tokens. Typically, a CrossChain Bridge entails using one Smart Contract to Lock or Burn tokens on the Source Chain and another to unlock or mint tokens on the Destination Chain.

- Typically, token bridges use a CrossChain messaging Protocol to transfer Tokens across Blockchains. A CrossChain Bridge is just a very precise application-specific service connecting two blockchains; many bridges are only CrossChain message Protocols.

- There are four major reasons some prefer bridges to exchanges-

1. **Price:** There may be substantial costs associated with swapping on an exchange and then sending to a different wallet. However, the costs might have been paid for only one bridge, once and for all. Even still, most bridges' transaction fees are incredibly cheap in comparison to what exchanges would have charged.

2. **Speed:** When compared to using a bridge, the processes needed in going via exchanges can take a long time.

3. **Approval Of airdrops:** Blockchain ecosystems that reward its users with frequent airdrops frequently promote decentralised on-chain interactions. Conversely, this is not advantageous to individuals who move assets through centralised markets.

4. **Decentralization:** Lastly, some people favour bridges over exchanges mostly due to personal preferences and the fact that bridges are more natural.

### What's the Need Of Router Nitro?

- Interactions that occur on a single blockchain do not necessitate trade-offs between security, trust, or adaptability; CrossChain communication does. This implies that composability—which is not necessary for composability across smart contracts on the same chain—can only be attained through intrinsic trade-offs in security, trust assumptions, or configuration flexibility between smart contracts on separate blockchains.

- Router Nitro is a state-of-the-art CrossChain bridge designed to facilitate the seamless transfer of assets across different blockchain networks. It ensures efficient and secure transactions, promoting greater interoperability in the blockchain ecosystem.

- Currently, adding new Chains to your dApp is expensive and can take a lot of time to Develop, Specifically if you want to add Non-EVM Chains.

Due to above all the above reasons stated, Router Nitro becomes really essential to use.

### Why to Use Router Nitro?

- Router Nitro is the most efficient intent based CrossChain Bridge in Web3. Nitro ensures fund safety by allowing forwarders to claim funds only after verified settlement, deterring malicious activities for robust security.

- Every new Smart Contract you launch needs to go through a Security Audit, so users can have trust in your Security. However, accessing Liquidity from other Chains is still impossible without going through a Bridging Process.

- Amongst all CrossChain Bridges, the amount Of Gas Overspent in Router Nitro is literally 0%.

- Router Nitro's additional Security module allows for perpetual updates to accomodate for Cryptographic Advances in Security.

1. Forwarders can claim funds only after verified settlement, deterring malicious activity.
2. Blockchain Level, Contract Level Security and Code Level Security.
3. Constant Security Updates, that make Nitro one step ahead of the Hackers.
